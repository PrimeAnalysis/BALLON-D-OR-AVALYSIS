When I was assigned the task of analyzing data for the Ballon d'Or 2023/24 season, I knew it was a great opportunity to sharpen my data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills. This is how I approached the project, the insights I gathered, and my recommendations based on the analysis.

My first step was to organize the raw data. Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned and structured the dataset to make it usable for further analysis. This involved removing duplicates, standardizing inconsistent entries (like player names or team names), and filling in missing data where applicable. It was a meticulous process, but getting the data clean and accurate is a crucial foundation for meaningful analysis.

Once the data was ready, I imported it into Power BI. Here, I created interactive visuals to uncover trends and patterns in the dataset. Power BI's ability to handle complex datasets and create dynamic visualizations allowed me to explore multiple dimensions of the Ballon d'Or nominations, including player positions, birth years, leagues, and teams. The dashboard was designed to be intuitive, focusing on clarity and functionality.

Key Statistics

Total Goals and Playing Time: Across all players, the total number of goals was 334, with a cumulative playing time of 839.2 hours. This highlights the offensive capabilities of the nominees.

Players by League: The Premier League dominated with 10 nominees, followed by La Liga (9), Bundesliga (6), Serie A (3), and Ligue 1 (2). This shows the Premier League’s consistent ability to attract and develop top talent.

Players by Position: Midfielders (MF) had the highest representation with 11 players, while forwards (FW) came in second with 9. Defenders (DF), goalkeepers (GK), and versatile players (PW/MF) had lower representation.

Goals by Position: Forwards were the top scorers with 111 goals, followed by midfielders (63 goals) and defenders (6 goals). Unsurprisingly, goalkeepers contributed the least, with only one goal.

Distribution by Birth Year and Nationality

The analysis of players by birth year showed a peak for those born in the late 1990s, with fewer younger nominees (born post-2000) in the spotlight. Geographically, Europe had the largest concentration of nominees, reflecting the dominance of European players in global football.

Contribution by Teams

Manchester City led the pack in goals scored by their nominees, contributing 54 goals. Other top-performing clubs included Real Madrid, Inter Milan, and Paris Saint-Germain. This underlines the role of elite clubs in fostering Ballon d'Or-level players.

Recommendations

Based on these insights, here are some actionable recommendations:

For Football Clubs: Clubs should prioritize developing midfielders and forwards, as they have the greatest impact on Ballon d’Or considerations. Investment in youth academies focused on offensive positions could yield future nominees.

For Leagues: Leagues outside the Premier League and La Liga should focus on retaining top talent and marketing their players globally to enhance recognition.

For Aspiring Players: Young players aiming for Ballon d’Or recognition should focus not only on scoring goals but also on creating opportunities and excelling in multiple roles.

For Analysts and Fans: Continued use of tools like Power BI for dynamic analysis can deepen understanding of player performance and trends, fostering informed discussions about nominations.

This project was an enriching experience for me. From organizing the dataset in Excel to visualizing it in Power BI, I gained practical insights into data handling and storytelling. Most importantly, the process underscored the value of data in uncovering stories behind achievements in football, paving the way for a more informed appreciation of the beautiful game.
